## Task 2: Teaching Claude Your Project

**Task:** Use /init to generate a starter CLAUDE.md, customize all 5 sections with project-specific details, and demonstrate through two live tests that Claude's behavior changes based on the file.

## Task 6: Connecting Claude to the Outside World

**Task:** Understand why MCP exists, configure the GitHub MCP server in .mcp.json, store credentials securely in settings.local.json, verify the connection with /mcp, and run a live query that proves Claude is working with real external data — not training data.


**Screenshot:**

## Task 7: Safety Rails for Your AI Agent

**Task:** Configure team-level permissions in settings.json, create a UserPromptSubmit hook that catches destructive intent before Claude processes the request, create a PreToolUse hook that blocks dangerous commands before they execute, and prove both hooks work through live tests.

## Task 10: Week 2 Reflection Blog

**Task:** Write a short reflection blog about your Week 2 learning journey. This assignment is not about writing code. It is about thinking clearly, explaining what you learned, and identifying how your mindset changed while working with Agentic AI, Claude Code, skills, subagents, MCP, hooks, permissions, and memory.


## Task 11: LinkedIn Post
